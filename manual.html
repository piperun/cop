<h1>Poses</h1>
<p>All of Yuuki's poses are controlled via the "Yuuki" prefix.
All pose attributes are persistent (body, face, etc), there is therefore no need to repeatedly run the same commands.
She will remain visible on the screen until <code>Yuuki.clear</code> is performed.
Her pose and visuals can be controlled in two ways:
<ul>
	<li>Using map event script commands (eg: <code>Yuuki.pose("AB")</code>)
		<p>This method is what was used originally and is still supported.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Using message text (eg: <code><i>{Yuuki.pose(AB)}</i>[Mayor] Glad to see you!</code>)
		<p>This method is new, and hopefully makes scripting easier because no special command is needed.
		The script fragment can be located anywhere in the message text, it does not need to be at the start.
		Because this method parses the message text itself, double quotes <i>"</i> are not to be used (saves some typing!)</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Available pose commands are:
<ul>
	<li><code>.pose(arg)</code>
		<p>Sets Yuuki's pose, <i>arg</i> must match a defined pose.</p>
	</li>
	<li><code>.face(arg)</code>
		<p>Sets Yuuki's face, <i>arg</i> must match a defined face.</p>
	</li>
	<li><code>.sweat(0/1)</code>
		<p>Toggles Yuuki's "sweat" attribute, changing visibility of any layer that depends this attribute.</p>
	</li>
	<li><code>.blush(0/1)</code>
		<p>Toggles Yuuki's "red" attribute, changing visibility of any layer that depends this attribute.</p>
	</li>
	<li><code>.slide(arg)</code> or <code>.slide</code>
		<p>Causes Yuuki to perform a "slide", a predefined motion effect for the current pose.
		It is possible to use any arbitrary slide motion via the <i>arg</i> parameter.</p>
	</li>
	<li><code>.shake(arg)</code> or <code>.shake</code>
		<p>Causes Yuuki to perform a "shake", generally involves making her boobs bounce.
		It is possible to use any arbitrary shake via the <i>arg</i> parameter.</p>
	</li>
	<li><code>.clear</code>
		<p>Removes Yuuki from the screen.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Pose Definitions</h1>
<p>Poses are defined in <code>scripts/CG_Poses.rb</code> (CG Poses in the editor) in the <code>POSES</code> constant.
This constant holds a map of command lists. The index of this map is the pose name. Names are arbitrary and can be anything.</p>
<p>Each pose consists of a list of commands. The first command usually is the <code>control</code> command,
setting the default X and Y coordinate for the pose. Following the <code>control</code> command are one or more <code>layer</code> commands.
These layer commands define the layer name, sprite filename and any conditions or attributes that layers require.</p>
<p>Layer order will match defined order exactly. It is possible to pre-allocate a layer by only defining the
layer name and leaving all other properties blank. This way it is possible to assign a specific Z-level to any layer.
This Z-level (as well as other properties) can be overridden later by setting <code>:z => N</code>.</p>
</p>
<h1>Face Definitions</h1>
<p>Faces are defined in <code>scripts/CG_Faces.rb</code> (CG Faces in the editor) in the <code>FACES</code> constant.</p>
This constant holds a map of commands. The index of this map is the face name. Names are arbitrary and can be anything.</p>
<p>Each face consists of a single <code>layer</code> command. This command sets the layer name that this face will occupy,
the sprite filename and any conditions or attributes that this layer requires.</p>
<h1>Shake Definitions</h1>
<p>Shakes are defined in <code>scripts/CG_Shakes.rb</code> (CG Shakes in the editor) in the <code>SHAKES</code> constant.</p>
This constant holds a map of command lists. The index of this map is the shake name. Names are arbitrary and can be anything.</p>
<p>Each shake consists of a list of commands. Most shakes tend to perform sprite overrides of existing layers via the
<code>layer</code> command. Performing <code>wait</code>s and playing <code>sfx</code> are also possibilities.</p>
<h1>Slide Definitions</h1>
<p>Slides are defined in <code>scripts/CG_Slides.rb</code> (CG Slides in the editor) in the <code>SLIDES</code> constant.</p>
This constant holds a map of command lists. The index of this map is the slide name. Names are arbitrary and can be anything.</p>
<p>Each slide consists of a list of commands. Most slides tend to perform tweens on existing layers via the
<code>tween</code> command.</p>
<h1>Layer Commands</h1>
<p>The following layer commands are implemented:
<ul>
<li><code>control({...})</code>
	<p>This command allows setting attributes on the sprite object as a whole.
	Most commonly this is used to define the X and Y origins of the sprite object.</p>
</li>
<li><code>layer(name, filename, {...})</code>
	<p>This command defines a sprite layer. The layer Z-level is automatically assigned using definition order.
	The name is mandatory but the filename and attributes are optional. Layer attributes are commonly used to define
	conditionals using the <code>:if</code> directive. This directive allows for complex logic and hooks directly into
	attributes (<code>attr(...)</code>), switches (<code>switch(...)</code>) and variables (<code>var(...)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><code>sfx(filename, volume, pitch)</code>
	<p>This command allows playback of arbitrary sound effects.
	The filename is mandatory but volume and pitch are option and will default to 100.</p>
</li>
<li><code>wait(duration)</code>
	<p>This command pauses command execution for a specified duration, in frames.</p>
</li>
<li><code>wait_for(condition)</code>
	<p>This command pauses command execution until a condition is met.
	The only supported condition at this time is <code>tween</code>, thus waiting until tweening is completed.</p>
</li>
<li><code>tween({...})</code>
	<p>This command allows arbitrary tweening of various sprite parameters. See existing slides for examples.</p>
</li>
<li><code>clear()</code>
	<p>This command erases all existing layers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
